# Support

This extension is built as open source which you are free to use as a basis for your implementation. As such this application DOES NOT come with a warranty/support. We are not responsible for the outcome of this integration over time.

Whilst fully functional, there are some considerations that you may want to consider for production use cases:

## Hosting
In order for teams to try the extension without boundaries, we have a URL which hosts the extension on a HTTPS URL. This is the `main` branch of the extension code and always on the latest version.

It is also hosted via a third party. In this case vercel adhering to their SLA's (99.99%).

For production use, we would recommend forking and hosting in an environment you are happy with. You can also chose to pull / merge updates into your fork and go through your own testing procedures.

## Watch
We would recommend that you watch this repository so that you can get notified of updates and releases.

## Customisation
Extensions are built as a working starting point. We expect customers to extend these to add their own specific functionality.

Whilst we will endeavour to maintain and keep up to date, we always recommend that production use cases are owned by the customer so that they are in full control.
